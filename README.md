# AGLCLaTeX

Forked from original code by McJones: https://github.com/McJones/

A Biblatex style implementing version 3 of the Australian Guide to Legal Citation

The Australian Guide to Legal Citation ('AGLC') is in my opinion one of the best and most flexible citation systems ever devised. This is despite its many detailed rules; in fact, it is probably the detail that contributes most to its flexibility, as it is very easy to find a close match for any source type.*

It is the citation system I learned when I was in law school, and it is currently the most widely used system for legal citations in Australia. The AGLC is published by the Melbourne University Law Review Association, and is available from the [University of Melbourne website](http://law.unimelb.edu.au/mulr/aglc/about) as a read-only PDF and to purchase in hard or soft copy.

Almost all of this is original work, built from scratch simply by following the Biblatex documentation. Small parts have been taken from various forum posts where I ran into difficulty. The parts for storing previous footnote numbers (the cite:save bibmacro) and some code for printing only surnames for the above n citations were taken from [Will Hardy's](https://github.com/willhardy/aglc) attempt at implementing the AGLC, so thanks to him.

The decision to create an entirely new style from scratch was due to the complexity of the AGLC. None of the existing styles was particularly suitable to modify, and while I could have built upon one and _heavily_ modified it, it seemed easier to simply take full control. This allowed me to learn the workings of Biblatex in some considerable detail. Additionally, as far as I could tell, Will was the only other person to attempt this and publish the result, but he was working with version 2 of the AGLC rather than version 3 (and there have been significant changes and expansions), and did not attempt a 'complete' solution.

*Note, this is the opinion of the code's original author, McJones. The current maintainers of the code differ wildly on the relative merits of the AGLC3. Regardless, standards are standards...

## General

AGLCLaTeX provides three basic citation commands:
- ```\cite{key2000}``` - creates a footnote for a single citation.
- ```\cites{key1}{key2}{key3}{etc}``` - creates a footnote for multiple citations.
- ```\textcite{key2000}``` - prints an in-text citation for a single citation.

### General format of footnotes

Full stops are automatically placed at the end of footnote citations.

```\cites{key1}{key2}{key3}{etc}``` will print each source in a footnote separated by a semicolon (';').

Pinpoint references should be enclosed in the postnote field: ```\cite[354]{key2000}```.

Pinpoints will usually be printed as they appear, and refer to page numbers. Some sources automatically convert the pinpoint to paragraph numbers in accordance with the AGLC (ie, the source doesn't include page numbers). To print paragraph numbers instead of page numbers (for sources that don't do this automatically) use the ```\para{}``` command: ```\cite[\para{354}]{key2000}```. If additional numbers follow, it may be necessary to include empty curly braces after the ```\para{}``` command: ```\cite[528, \para{57}{} n 6, 529 \para{64}]{key2000}```.

Spans of pinpoint references should be separated by two hyphens and no space:
- ```\cite[431--2]{key2000}``` - for page numbers.
- ```\cite[57--63]{key2000}``` - for sources that always refer to paragraph numbers by default.
- ```\cite[\para{57--63}]{key2000}``` - to use paragraphs with a source that uses page numbers by default.
- ```\cite[312--13 \para{15--18}]{key2000}``` - to use pages and paragraphs with a source that uses page numbers by default.

### Introductory signals

Introductory signals such as 'See', 'See, eg,' and 'See also' should be enclosed in the prenote field: ```\cite[See][293]{key2000}```. Note that if no pinpoint is included, an empty set of square brackets should be included after the prenote, otherwise the prenote will be taken to be the postnote: ```\cite[See, eg,][]{key2000}```.

### Sources referring to other sources

AGLCLaTeX provides four citation commands for sources referring to other sources:

- ```\quoting{key1}{key2}``` - where the first source quotes the second source,
- ```\quotedin{key1}{key2}``` - where the first source is quoted in the second source,
- ```\citing{key1}{key2}``` - where the first source refers to the second source, and
- ```\citedin{key1}{key2}``` - where the first source is referred to in the second source.

These are used like ```\cites``` and all support prenotes for introductory signals and postnotes for pinpoints.

Note that these should only be used for two sources. Citing more than two sources in this way is currently not supported and will produce incorrect results.

### Subsequent references

In compliance with the AGLC:

- Repeated citations print 'Ibid' and a pinpoint or other postnote, unless:
- the postnote is identical to the previous citation, or
- there are multiple sources in the previous footnote.

If the postnote is identical, only 'Ibid' is printed. If there are multiple sources in the previous footnote, the surname of the author or editor is printed, followed by ', above n' and the footnote number of the _first_ instance of that source, unless the AGLC requires to be printed in full. If the pinpoint is different, a pinpoint is printed. This requires the document to be compiled _twice_ after running Bibtex.

**AGLCLaTeX does not currently support short titles**

Dates for sources should be in ```YYYY-MM--DD``` format: ```Date = {2000-01-01}```. Individual authors and editors should be separated with 'and' (do not use commas, even for more than two authors): ```Author = {John Smith and Jane Doe}```. Corporate authors should be enclosed in double curly braces to prevent unintended splitting: ```Author: {{Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade}}```.

**AGLCLaTeX does not currently support the bibliography format of the AGLC**

For other formatting (headings, etc.) see the sample template AGLC3.tex

## Domestic sources

### Cases

AGLCLaTex provides for several different types of cases, as covered by the AGLC:

- ```@case-gen-volume``` - for reported cases in a report series arranged by volume,
- ```@case-gen-year``` - for reported cases in a report series arranged by year (which may include volumes within that year),
- ```@case-gen-mnc``` - for unreported cases with a medium neutral citation,
- ```@case-gen-unreported``` - for unreported cases without a medium neutral citation, and
- ```@arbitration``` - for domestic arbitrations.

Administrative decisions that are reported or unreported should be cited as cases.

Refer to the AGLC for formatting rules. Note that:
- administrative decisions typically use 'and' instead of 'v' to separate party names,
- judges' names should conform with the AGLC rules, and
- if necessary, additional information can be included in the postnote.

#### Reported decisions

- _R v Tang_ (2008) 237 CLR 1.

```
@case-gen-volume{tang2008,
Title  = {R v Tang},
Date   = {2008},
Volume = {237},
Series = {CLR},
Pages  = {1}}
```

- _Bakker v Stewart_ [1980] VR 70.

```
@case-gen-year{bakker1980,
Title  = {Bakker v Stewart},
Date   = {1980},
Series = {VR},
Pages  = {17}}
```

- _Rowe v McCartney_ [1976] 2 NSWLR 72.

```
@case-gen-year{rowe1976,
Title  = {Rowe v McCartney},
Date   = {1976},
Volume = {2},
Series = {NSWLR},
Pages  = {72}}
```

The ```Pages``` field can be replaced with a different identifier (such as a paragraph number) if that's how the reports are set out.

Both ```@case-gen-volume``` and ```@case-gen-year``` allow for the ```venue``` field, which may specify the court if relevant or necessary:

- _Aldrick v EM Investments (Qld) Pty Ltd_ [2000] 2 Qd R 346 (Court of Appeal).

```
@case-gen-year{aldrick2000,
Title  = {Aldrick v EM Investments (Qld) Pty Ltd},
Date   = {2000},
Volume = {2},
Series = {Qd R},
Pages  = {346},
Venue  = {Court of Appeal}}
```

#### Unreported decisions with a Medium Neutral Citation

- _Quarmby v Keating_ [2009] TASSC 80 (9 September 2009).

```
@case-gen-mnc{quarmby2009,
Title  = {Quarmby v Keating},
Date   = {2009-09-09},
Venue  = {TASSC},
Number = {80}}
```

#### Unreported decisions without a Medium Neutral Citation

- _Barton v Chibber_ (Unreported, Supreme Court of Victoria, Hampel J, 29 June 1989).

```
@case-gen-unreported{barton1989,
Title  = {Barton v Chibber},
Venue  = {Supreme Court of Victoria},
Author = {Hampel J},
Date   = {1989-06-29}}
```

#### Case history

AGLCLaTeX supports two citation commands for affirmed and reversed decisions:

- ```\affirmed{key1}{key2}``` - where the first source was affirmed (upheld) by the second source, and
- ```\reversed{key1}{key2}``` - where the first source was reversed by the second source.

These are used like ```\cites``` and both support prenotes for introductory signals and postnotes for pinpoints.

Note that these should only be used for two sources. Citing more than two sources in this way is currently not supported and will produce incorrect results.

#### Quasi-judicial decisions (administrative decisions and arbitrations)

Administrative decisions should cited as cases (ie, using ```@case-gen-volume```, ```@case-gen-year```, ```@case-gen-mnc``` or ```@case-gen-unreported```).

Arbitrations use the ```@arbitration``` entry type. Arbitrations may or may not have a title; if an arbitration does not the title can be safely omitted.

```
@arbitration{beckman1988,
Title  = {Beckman Instruments Inc v Overseas Private Investment Corporation},
Note   = {Award and Opinion},
Venue  = {American Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Tribunal},
Type   = {Case},
Number = {16 199 00209 87G},
Date   = {1988-02-20}}
```

```
@arbitration{sandline1998,
Title  = {Sandline International v Papua New Guinea},
Note   = {Award},
Venue  = {Sir Edward Somers, Sir Michael Kerr and Sir Daryl Dawson},
Date   = {1998-10-09}}
```

```
@arbitration{nai1930,
Note   = {Final Award},
Venue  = {Netherlands Arbitration Institute},
Type   = {Case},
Number = {1930},
Date   = {1999-10-12}}

```

**AGLCLaTeX does not currently support arbitrations reported in other sources (eg, reported series and books).**

#### Transcripts of proceedings

AGLCLaTeX provides for two kinds of court transcripts:

- ```@case-transcript``` - for citing court transcripts in general, and
- ```@case-transcript-hca``` - for citing High Court of Australia transcripts _from July 2003 onwards_.

If appropriate, the speaker's name can be included in the postnote alongside the pinpoint.

High Court of Australia transcripts are cited very similarly to unreported decisions with Medium Neutral Citations.

```
@case-transcript{celano2009,
Title  = {Celano v Swan},
Venue  = {County Court of Victoria},
Number = {09/0867},
Author = {Judge Lacava},
Date   = {2009-08-27}}
```

```
@case-transcript-hca{ruhani2005,
Title  = {Ruhani v Director of Police},
Date   = {2005-04-19},
Number = {205}}
```

#### Submissions in Cases

```
@case-submission{agcth2005,
Author    = {Attorney-General (Cth)},
Title     = {Outline of Submissions of the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth as Amicus Curiae},
Maintitle = {Human Society International Inc v Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd},
Number    = {NSD 1519/2004},
Date      = {2005-01-25}}
```

#### Subsequent References

In accordance with the AGLC:
- 'Ibid' is used for all cases and related materials, and
- 'above n' is not used for cases and related materials.

### Legislative materials

#### Statutes (Acts of Parliament), Australian Constitutions, and Delegated Legislation

AGLCLaTeX uses the ```@act-gen``` entry type for statutes, constitutions and delegated legislation:

```
@act-gen{crimesact1958vic,
Title    = {Crimes Act},
Year     = {1958},
Location = {Vic}}
```

```
@act-gen{ausconstitution,
Title = {Australian Constitution}}
```

```
@act-gen{policeregs2003vic,
Title    = {Police Regulations},
Year     = {2003},
Location = {Vic}}
```

#### Quasi-Legislative Materials

AGLCLaTeX provides for several different types of quasi-legislative materials, as covered by the AGLC:

- ```@gazette``` - government gazettes,
- ```@govt-order``` - orders and rulings of government instrumentalities and officers,
- ```@non-govt-order``` - legislation delegated to non-government entities, and
- ```@practice-direction``` - court practice directions and practice notes.

Gazette notices can specify an author and a notice title, or neither.

Gazette notice with author and title:

```
@gazette{gaz1997cth,
Author    = {Minister for Lands (WA)},
Title     = {\textit{Land Acquisition and Public Works Act 1902 --- Native Title Act 1993} (Commonwealth) --- Notice of Intention to Take Land for a Public Work},

Number = {TR 2005/1},
Date   = {2005-01-12}}
```

Legislation delegated to non-government entities:

```

Title       = {Amendment of Practice Directio No 1 of 2000},
Date        = {2006-09-05}}
```

#### Bills

AGLCLaTeX uses the ```@bill-gen``` entry type for bills, which are otherwise cited like regular legislation:

```
@bill-gen{corpamendbill2005cth,
Title    = {Corporations Amendment Bill No 1},
Year     = {2005},
Location = {Cth}}
```

#### Explanatory Memoranda, Statements and Notes

AGLCLaTeX uses the ```@bill-gen-exp``` entry type for explanatory memorada, statements and note, which are otherwise cited like regular legislation, but with the type of document specified:

```
@bill-gen-exp{exphrcharter2006vic,
Type     = {Explanatory Memorandum},
Title    = {Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Bill},
Year     = {2006},
Location = {Vic}}
```

#### Legislative history

AGLCLaTeX provides for seven different types of commands designed for legislative history. These can be used, if appropriate, for other sources:

- ```\asamendedby{key1}{key2}``` - where the first source is as amended by the second source,
- ```\lateramendedby{key1}{key2}``` - where the first source was later amended by the second source,
- ```\amending{key1}{key2}``` - where the first source is amending the second source,
- ```\asrepealedby{key1}{key2}``` - where the first source was repealed by the second source,
- ```\repealing{key1}{key2}``` - where the first source is repealing the second source,
- ```\asinsertedby{key1}{key2}``` - where the first source was inserted by the second source, and
- ```\inserting{key1}{key2}``` - where the first source is inserting the second source.

These are used like ```\cites``` and all support prenotes for introductory signals and postnotes for pinpoints.

Note that these should only be used for two sources. Citing more than two sources in this way is currently not supported and will produce incorrect results.

#### Subsequent References

In accordance with the AGLC:
- 'Ibid' is used for all legislation and related materials, and
- 'above n' is not used for legislation and related materials.

  - parliamentary debates/Hansard,
  - evidence to parliamentary committees,
  - Australian constitutional convention debates,
  - interviews, and
  - written correspondence.

## International materials

### Treaties

AGLCLaTeX provides for three kinds of treaties:

- ```@treaty-volume``` - for treaties published in a treaty series organised by volume (eg, UNTS),
- ```@treaty-year``` - for treaties published in a treaty series organised by year (eg, ATS), and
- ```@treaty-number``` - for treaties published in a treaty series organised by sequential order (eg, CETS).

Each also accepts the same four types:

- ```Type = {open-if}``` - for open multilateral treaties which are in force,
- ```Type = {open-nif}``` - for open multilateral treaties which are not yet in force,
- ```Type = {closed-if}``` - for closed treaties which are in force, and
- ```Type = {closed-nif}``` - for closed treaties which are not yet in force.

AGLCLaTeX implements the complicated rules that the AGLC sets out for each in chapter 7. It's unnecessary to repeat those rules, but to explain the operation:

- ```Type = {open-if}``` and ```Type = {open-nif}``` will print 'opened for signature DD MM YYYY' where appropriate.
- ```Type = {closed-if}``` and ```Type = {closed-nif}``` will print 'signed DD MM YYYY' where appropriate.
- ```Type = {open-if}``` and ```Type = {closed-if}``` will print '(entered into force DD MM YYYY)' where appropriate.
- ```Type = {open-nif}``` and ```Type = {closed-nif}``` will print '(not yet in force)' where appropriate.

The ```Origdate``` field is used for the _date of conclusion_ of the treaty (ie, the date it was signed). The ```Date``` field is used for the _entry into force date_.

The entry into force date will _always_ be later than the date of conclusion, unless the treaty was signed and entered into force at the same time. If a treaty is not yet in force, the ```Date``` field can be safely omitted.

In the case of treaties that were concluded and entered into force on the same date, repeat the date in both the ```Origdate``` and ```Date``` fields. This will then print '(signed and entered into force DD MM YYYY)' where appropriate.

The ```Author``` field contains the parties to the treaty, but should be omitted if there are more than three, and should be separated by en-dashes (in LaTeX, --) in accordance with the AGLC. Parties should also be omitted if named in the title of the treaty.

For treaties published in a series arranged by year, the year should be put in the ```Volume``` field.

The ```Pages``` field should be used for the starting page _only_ of the treaty where relevant.

Illustrated examples are given below.

- _Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons_, opened for signature 1 July 1968, 729 UNTS 161 (entered into force 5 March 1970).

```
@treaty-volume{npt1968,

Origdate = {2001-11-23},
Series   = {ETS},
Number   = {185},
Date     = {2004-07-01}}
```

#### Subsequent references

In accordance with the AGLC:
- 'Ibid' is used for treaties, and
- 'above n' is not used.

### United Nations materials

#### Constitutive document

The _Charter of the United Nations_ should be cited using the ```@act-gen``` entry type:

```
@act-gen{uncharter,
Title = {Charter of the United Nations}}
```

```\cite[art 51]{uncharter}``` will produce '_Charter of the United Nations_ art 51.'

**AGLCLaTeX does not currently support other United Nations materials**

### International Court of Justice and Permanent Court of International Justice

#### Constitutive and basic documents

The _Statute of the International Court of Justice_ and _Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice_ should be cited using the ```@act-gen``` entry type:

```
@act-gen{icjstatute,
Title = {Statute of the International Court of Justice}}
```

```
@act-gen{pcijstatute,
Title = {Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice}}
```

Rules of court for both the ICJ and PCIJ are cited using the ```@rulesofcourt``` entry type:

```
@rulesofcourt{icj1978,
Institution = {International Court of Justice},
Date        = {1978-04-14}}
```

```
@rulesofcourt{pcij1922,
Institution = {Permanent Court of International Justice},
Date        = {1922-03-24}}
```

#### Reported decisions

AGLCLaTeX provides for both International Court of Justice and Permanent Court of International Justice decisions:

- ```@case-icj-reported``` - for International Court of Justice decisions, and
- ```@case-pcij-reported``` - for Permanent Court of International Justice decisions.

The first three fields of each are the same:

- ```Title``` takes the case name and if applicable the parties' names, which should go in parentheses,
- ```Type``` takes the phase or type of the decision (eg, 'Judgment', 'Jurisdiction' or 'Advisory Opinion'), and
- ```Year``` takes the year of the volume of the report series.

ICJ cases have one additional field:

- ```Pages``` takes the starting page only of the case.

PCIJ cases have two additional fields:

- ```Series``` takes the letter of the series (either 'A', 'B' or 'A/B'), and
- ```Number``` takes the number of the decision.

```
@case-icj-reported{easttimor1995,
Title = {East Timor (Portugal v Australia)},
Type  = {Judgment},
Year  = {1995},
Pages = {90}}
```

```
@case-icj-reported{westernsahara1975,
Title = {Western Sahara},
Type  = {Advisory Opinion},
Year  = {1975},
Pages = {12}}
```

```
@case-pcij-reported{mavrommatis1924,
Title  = {Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions (Greece v United Kingdom)},
Type   = {Jurisdiction},
Year   = {1924},
Series = {A},
Number = {2}}
```

#### Reported pleadings and other documents originating in ICJ and PCIJ proceedings

AGLCLaTeX provides for reported pleadings and similar documents in both ICJ and PCIJ proceedings:

- ```@icj-pleading-reported``` - for documents from the International Court of Justice, and
- ```@pcij-pleading-reported``` - for documents from the Permanent Court of International Justice.

Both use the ```Title``` field for the title of the document, and ```Maintitle``` for the title of the proceedings. ```Maintitle``` should be in the same format as the title for cases: ```Maintitle = {Title (Parties)}``` or ```Maintitle = {Title (Advisory Opinion)}```. The ```Year``` field takes the year of the volume (preferred) or the year of the decision (if the year of the volume is unavailable). The ```Pages``` field takes the starting page only of the document.

```@icj-pleading-reported``` can also take the volume number cited, which is in Roman numerals, in the ```Volume``` field.

```@pcij-pleading-reported``` can take the number and part (if applicable) of the document in the ```Number``` and ```Part``` fields.

```
@icj-pleading-reported{denmark1962,
Title     = {Written Statement of the Government of the Kingdom of Denmark},
Maintitle = {Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Advisory Opinion)},
Year      = {1962},
Pages     = {137}}
```

```

```

```

Title     = {Memorial Filed by the Government of His Britannic Majesty},
Maintitle = {Treaty of Lausanne, Article 3, Paragraph 2 (Advisory Opinion)},
Year      = {1925},
Number    = {10},
Pages     = {198}}
```

```
@pcij-pleading-reported{budding1928,
Title     = {Speech by Dr Budding},
Maintitle = {Rights of Minorities in Upper Silesia (Germany v Poland)},
Year      = {1928},
Number    = {14},
Part      = {II},
Pages     = {20}}
```

#### Unreported decisions

```@case-icj-unreported``` is used for unreported decisions of the International Court of Justice. These are cited essentially the same as reported decisions; the differences are handled by AGLCLaTeX automatically. However, there are some slight differences:

```
@case-icj-unreported{icj2008-06-04,
Title  = {Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v France)},
Type   = {Judgment},
Number = {136},
Date   = {2008-06-04}}
```

#### Unreported pleadings and other documents originating in ICJ proceedings

```@icj-pleading-unreported``` is used for unreported pleadings, etc, originating in ICJ proceedings.

It bears similarities to reported pleadings and unreported decisions: the ```Title``` is used for the title of the document and ```Maintitle``` is used for the title of the proceedings. Otherwise they are cited the same as unreported decisions:

```
@icj-pleading-unreported{icj2008-03-31,
Title     = {Application Instituting Proceedings},
Maintitle = {Aerial Herbicide Spraying (Ecuador v Colombia)},
Number    = {138},
Date      = {2008-03-31}}
```

### International arbitral and tribunal decisions

Unlike the AGLC, AGLCLaTeX does not differentiate between state-state and individual-state decisions by international arbitrations and tribunals. They are essentially cited the same way as Australian domestic cases. There are three entry types supported:

- ```@case-intl-volume``` - for reported decisions published in reports organised by volume,
- ```@case-intl-year``` - for reported decisions published in reports organised by year, and
- ```@case-intl-unreported``` - for unreported decisions.

Reported decisions support the ```Venue``` field which can be used for the name of the court or tribunal if it's not apparent from the report series (or simply for clarification).

Further, reported and unreported decisions of international criminal tribunals and courts should be cited using these same entry types: the AGLC prefers them to be cited in the same manner as unreported cases unless they are obscure and a reported version would aid retrieval. The ```Venue``` field should include both the court and the chamber if applicable (eg, ```Venue = {Special Court for Sierra Leone, Trial Chamber I}```.

There are no examples provided for ```@case-intl-year```, but ```@case-intl-volume``` and ```@case-intl-year``` take essentially the same fields; ```Volume``` is optional for reports organised by year.

Also note that like ICJ and PCIJ cases, these all use the ```Type``` field for the phase (or stage) of the proceedings, per the examples below.

- Reported state v state decision.

```
@case-intl-volume{bluefintuna2000,

Refer to [international arbitral and tribunal decisions](#international-arbitral-and-tribunal-decisions) above.

**AGLCLaTeX does not currently support other international materials**

## Foreign domestic materials

### Canada

#### Cases

Canadian cases, administrative decisions and arbitrations should be cited the same as the respective Australian materials (see examples above), using:

- ```@case-gen-volume``` - for reported cases in a report series arranged by volume,
- ```@case-gen-year``` - for reported cases in a report series arranged by year (which may include volumes within that year),
- ```@case-gen-mnc``` - for unreported cases with a medium neutral citation,
- ```@case-gen-unreported``` - for unreported cases without a medium neutral citation, and
- ```@arbitration``` - for domestic arbitrations.

In accordance with the AGLC: when citing a nominate report (published under the name of the reporter between 1537 and 1865) this should be accompanied with a citation of the _English Reports_ ('ER') or _Revised Reports_ ('RR'). This can be done using the ```\cites``` command and chaining two citations back-to-back, albeit with some complexity. This is currently untested, but should work. They can also therefore take separate pinpoints (but postnotes to follow the whole should go in the postnote of the second entrykey.

Example: ```\cites{russel1661a}{russel1661b}``` should print: _Russel v Lee_ (1661) 1 Lev 86; 83 ER 310 in accordance with the following entries.

```
@case-gen-volume{russel1661a,
Title  = {Russel v Lee},
Year   = {1661},
Volume = {1},
Series = {Lev},
Pages  = {86}}

@case-gen-volume{russel1661b,
Volume = {83},
Series = {ER},
Pages  = {310}}
```

Likewise, ```\cites[345]{janvrin1861a}[336 (Lord Kingsdown)]{janvrin1861b}``` should print: _Janvrin v De La Mare_ (1861) 14 Moo 334, 345; 15 ER 332, 336 (Lord Kingsdown). Entries for this example have been omitted.

### United States of America

#### Cases

AGLCLaTeX provides for both reported and unreported US cases:

- ```@case-us-reported```, and
- ```@case-us-unreported```.

There are relatively complex rules with regard to jurisdiction and court name, which can be found in the AGLC 24.1.5. The basic rules are:

- Do not include the name of the court if citing a decision of the US Supreme Court.
- Courts of Appeals should be referred to by number ('1st Cir', '2nd Cir'), except the DC Circuit ('DC Cir') and Federal Circuit ('Fed Cir').
	- When citing numbered circuits, use the ```\nth``` command to enclose the number to make it an ordinal: ```Venue = {\nth{1} Cir}```.
- Federal District Court decisions should have an abbreviated form of the district (but not division) and the state abbreviation, such as:
	- 'D Del' --- (District of Delaware).
	- 'CD Cal' --- (Central District of California).
	- 'ED Mo' --- (Middle District of New Hampshire).
- State Courts should have an abbreviated form of the jurisdiction (ie, state) followed by the conventional abbreviated name of the court, unless the jurisdiction is apparent from the title of the report series (omit the jurisdiction) or it is the highest court in the state (omit the court name):
	- _Brogdon v State_, 467 SE 2d 598 (**Ga Ct App**, 1996).
	- _Poire v CL Peck/Jones Brothers Construction Corporation Inc_, 46 Cal Rptr 2d 631 (**Ct App**, 1995).
	- _Burr v Maclay Rancho Water Co_, 98 P 260 (**Cal**, 1908).

```
@case-us-reported{bush2004,
Title  = {Bush v Schiavo},
Volume = {885},
Series = {So 2d},
Pages  = {336},
Venue  = {Fla},
Year   = {2004}}
```

Note that for citations of US Supreme Court decisions prior to 1875 (prior to volume 90 US), a parallel citation should be included of the early American report series in parentheses in the ```Series``` field. 

```
@case-us-reported{winchester1804,
Title  = {Winchester v Hackley},
Volume = {6},
Series = {US (2 Cranch)},
Pages  = {342},
Year   = {1804}}
```

Unreported cases must specify the type of docket or reference number (eg, 'Civ No' or 'No') in accordance with the decision:

```
@case-us-unreported{redhat2004,
Title  = {Red Hat Inc v The SCO Group Inc},
Venue  = {D Del},
Number = {Civ No 03-772-SLR},
Date   = {2004-04-06}}
```
